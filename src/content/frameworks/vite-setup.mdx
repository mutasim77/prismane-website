To use Prismane inside your website or app, you should install it first, by running one of the following commands:

```js
  npm i @prismane/core
```

```js
  yarn add @prismane/core
```

```js
  pnpm add @prismane/core
```

After installing the `@prismane/core` package, you have to wrap your application with our custom `PrismaneProvider` component. This can be either in your `index.jsx/tsx` or your `App.jsx/tsx`.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { PrismaneProvider } from "@prismane/core";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <PrismaneProvider>
      <App />
    </PrismaneProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

## Additional Setup

### Icons Used In Examples

<Important>
  Prismane does not include the icons that are used in examples!
</Important>

If you want to use the icons that are used inside of the examples, you must install the `@phosphor-icons/react` library.

### Fonts Used In Examples

<Important>
  Prismane does not include the fonts that are used in examples!
</Important>

If you want to use the fonts that are used inside of the examples, you must install the `@fontsource/inter` library.

### Custom Theme

If you want to use a custom theme, with custom colors, spacing and more, you can achieve that by providing a `theme` prop to the `PrismaneProvider` component.

You can achieve that functionality by importing the `extendTheme` function from `@prismane/core/themes`. This function allows you to extend the Prismanebase theme with your custom options.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { PrismaneProvider } from "@prismane/core";
import { extendTheme } from "@prismane/core/themes";

const theme = extendTheme({
  colors: {
    primary: {
      100: "#ffffff",
    },
  },
});

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <PrismaneProvider theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </PrismaneProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
