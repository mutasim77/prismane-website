Our package exports prop types for each of our components. They can be found useful by some developers. To access them just add `Props` to the component's name. They are exported at `@prismane/core`.

For example, the `<Button/>` component's prop types can be imported by doing the following:

```tsx
import { ButtonProps } from "@prismane/core";
```
