# Installation

To use Prismane inside your website or app, you should install it first, by running one of the following commands:

_npm_
`npm install @prismane/core`

_yarn_
`yarn add @prismane/core`

After installing the `@prismane/core` package, you have to wrap your application with our custom `PrismaneProvider` component. This can be either in your `index.jsx/tsx` or your `App.jsx/tsx`.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import Application from "../somewhere";
import { PrismaneProvider } from "@prismane/core";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <PrismaneProvider>
      <Application />
    </PrismaneProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Additional Setup

## Custom Theme

If you want to use a custom theme, with custom colors, spacing and more, you can achieve that by providing a `theme` prop to the `PrismaneProvider` component.

You can achieve that functionality by importing the `extendTheme` function from `@prismane/core/themes`. This function allows you to extend the Prismanebase theme with your custom options.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import Application from "../somewhere";
import { PrismaneProvider } from "@prismane/core";
import { extendTheme } from "@prismane/core/themes";

const App = () => {
  const theme = extendTheme({
    colors: {
      primary: {
        100: "#ffffff",
      },
    },
  });

  return (
    <PrismaneProvider theme={theme}>
      <Application />
    </PrismaneProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```
