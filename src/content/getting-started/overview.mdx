# Overview

Prismane is built with simplicity and performance in mind. In this guide we will explore how Prismaneis built, what core features it offers, what makes it better and much more.

Our key features consist of:

- **Style memoization:** Per key memoization of styles, which offers greatly improved performance, whilst still keeping the dynamic styling that is required in some edge cases.
- **Hooks:** Prebuilt React hooks, giving you the ease of use and peace of mind, that is required in building great software.
- **Form building:** We have built a custom `useForm` hook, which allows you to easily build controlled forms with no third party software needed.
- **Form validation:** We have build a set of useful form validator functions, which would give you the ability to validate your forms faster than ever.
- **Styling system:** We have created a styling system that is easily customizable, overwritable, having built in support for dark mode, as well as simple and easy to use.
- **Themable:** We have made our library easily themable out of the box. You can choose primary and base colors out of our prebuilt color palette or you could provide your own.

## Package Structure

Our package has multiple entries for it's different tools. Here we are going to list them and explain what every one of them provides:

- `@prismane/core` This entry exports all of the components, their prop types and constants.
- `@prismane/core/validators` This entry exports all of the prebuilt form validators.
- `@prismane/core/hooks` This entry exports all of the prebuilt React hooks.
- `@prismane/core/themes` This entry exports all of the prebuilt theming tools.

## Constants

Our package exports a set of constants that can be useful during development. They are exported from the `@prismane/core` entry and consist of:

- `PRISMANE_COLORS` This constant contains all of Prismane's pre-baked colors.
- `PRISMANE_DEFAULT_COLORS_MAP` This constant is a map of Prismane's color names, meaning that **it does not include _primary_ or _base_ colors**.
- `PRISMANE_COLORS_MAP` This constant extends the `PRISMANE_DEFAULT_COLORS_MAP` and adds the values of **_primary_** and **_base_**.
- `PRISMANE_SHADES_MAP` This constant is a map of all of Prismane's color shades.

###

```tsx
import {
  PRISMANE_COLORS,
  PRISMANE_DEFAULT_COLORS_MAP,
  PRISMANE_COLORS_MAP,
  PRISMANE_SHADES_MAP,
} from "@prismane/core";
```

## Global Types

Our package exports a set of global types that are used throughout components and can be useful during development. They are exported from the `@prismane/core` entry.

```tsx
type PrismaneBreakpoints = "xs" | "sm" | "base" | "md" | "lg";

type PrismaneShades = 50 | 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | 600 | 700 | 800 | 900;

type PrismaneColors =
  | "primary"
  | "base"
  | "slate"
  | "gray"
  | "coal"
  | "sepia"
  | "red"
  | "orange"
  | "copper"
  | "yellow"
  | "lime"
  | "green"
  | "emerald"
  | "teal"
  | "cyan"
  | "diamond"
  | "blue"
  | "amethyst"
  | "violet"
  | "purple"
  | "magenta"
  | "pink"
  | "ruby";

type PrismaneAnimations =
  | "fade"
  | "scale"
  | "scale-y"
  | "scale-x"
  | "skew-up"
  | "skew-down"
  | "rotate-left"
  | "rotate-right"
  | "slide-down"
  | "slide-up"
  | "slide-left"
  | "slide-right"
  | "roll"
  | "pulse"
  | "shake"
  | "bounce"
  | "flip";

type PrismanePositions =
  | "top-start"
  | "top"
  | "top-end"
  | "right-start"
  | "right"
  | "right-end"
  | "bottom-end"
  | "bottom"
  | "bottom-start"
  | "left-end"
  | "left"
  | "left-start";

type PrismaneTransitions =
  | "all"
  | "colors"
  | "opacity"
  | "shadow"
  | "transform";

interface PrismaneFieldComponent {
  name?: string;
  id?: string;
  error?: string | null;
  label?: string;
  value?: string | number;
  defaultValue?: string | number;
  size?: PrismaneBreakpoints;
  variant?: "outlined" | "filled" | "underlined" | "unstyled";
  addons?: React.ReactNode;
}
```

## Prop Types

Our package exports prop types for each of our components. They can be found useful by some developers. To access them just add `Props` to the component's name. They are exported at `@prismane/core`.

For example, the `<Button/>` component's prop types can be imported by doing the following:

```tsx
import { ButtonProps } from "@prismane/core";
```

## Component Prop Inheritance

Our components are built in a way that they extend their child's props. For example, the `<Flex/>` component extends it's child props, in this case the `<Box/>` component's props.

```tsx
// import { Flex } from "@prismane/core";

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <Flex
      w={20} // Box component's prop
      align="center" // Flex component's prop
    >
      Hello, world
    </Flex>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

## Versatile Components

Some of our components are versatile, meaning that they have the ability to change their root element for an element that you have passed. They have an additional `as` prop. By default versatile components render as a `<div/>` element.

```tsx
import { Flex } from "@prismane/core";

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <Flex as="a" href="#">
      Hello, world
    </Flex>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

This code snippet will render an anchor tag that has display property of flex.

## Passing refs

All of our components use the `forwardRef` function, so that you can easily pass a ref to the component by using the `ref` prop.

```tsx
import { useRef } from "react";
import { Flex } from "@prismane/core";

const Page = () => {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  return <Flex ref={ref}>Hello, world</Flex>;
};

export default Page;
```
