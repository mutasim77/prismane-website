## Package Structure

Our package has multiple entries for it's different tools. Here we are going to list them and explain what every one of them provides:

- `@prismane/core` This entry exports all of the components, their prop types and constants.
- `@prismane/core/validators` This entry exports all of the prebuilt form validators.
- `@prismane/core/hooks` This entry exports all of the prebuilt React hooks.
- `@prismane/core/themes` This entry exports all of the prebuilt theming tools.

## Constants

Our package exports a set of constants that can be useful during development. They are exported from the `@prismane/core` entry and consist of:

- `PRISMANE_COLORS` This constant contains all of Prismane's pre-baked colors.
- `PRISMANE_DEFAULT_COLORS_MAP` This constant is a map of Prismane's color names, meaning that **it does not include _primary_ or _base_ colors**.
- `PRISMANE_COLORS_MAP` This constant extends the `PRISMANE_DEFAULT_COLORS_MAP` and adds the values of **_primary_** and **_base_**.
- `PRISMANE_SHADES_MAP` This constant is a map of all of Prismane's color shades.

```tsx
import {
  PRISMANE_COLORS,
  PRISMANE_DEFAULT_COLORS_MAP,
  PRISMANE_COLORS_MAP,
  PRISMANE_SHADES_MAP,
} from "@prismane/core";
```

## Global Types

Our package exports a set of global types that are used throughout components and can be useful during development. They are exported from the `@prismane/core` entry.

```tsx
type PrismaneBreakpoints = "xs" | "sm" | "base" | "md" | "lg";

type PrismaneShades = 50 | 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | 600 | 700 | 800 | 900;

type PrismaneColors =
  | "primary"
  | "base"
  | "slate"
  | "gray"
  | "coal"
  | "sepia"
  | "red"
  | "orange"
  | "copper"
  | "yellow"
  | "lime"
  | "green"
  | "emerald"
  | "teal"
  | "cyan"
  | "diamond"
  | "blue"
  | "amethyst"
  | "violet"
  | "purple"
  | "magenta"
  | "pink"
  | "ruby";

type PrismaneAnimations =
  | "fade"
  | "scale"
  | "scale-y"
  | "scale-x"
  | "skew-up"
  | "skew-down"
  | "rotate-left"
  | "rotate-right"
  | "slide-down"
  | "slide-up"
  | "slide-left"
  | "slide-right"
  | "roll"
  | "pulse"
  | "shake"
  | "bounce"
  | "flip";

type PrismanePositions =
  | "top-start"
  | "top"
  | "top-end"
  | "right-start"
  | "right"
  | "right-end"
  | "bottom-end"
  | "bottom"
  | "bottom-start"
  | "left-end"
  | "left"
  | "left-start";

type PrismaneTransitions =
  | "all"
  | "colors"
  | "opacity"
  | "shadow"
  | "transform";

interface PrismaneFieldComponent {
  name?: string;
  id?: string;
  error?: string | null;
  label?: string;
  value?: string | number;
  defaultValue?: string | number;
  size?: PrismaneBreakpoints;
  variant?: "outlined" | "filled" | "underlined" | "unstyled";
  addons?: React.ReactNode;
}
```

## Prop Types

Our package exports prop types for each of our components. They can be found useful by some developers. To access them just add `Props` to the component's name. They are exported at `@prismane/core`.

For example, the `<Button/>` component's prop types can be imported by doing the following:

```tsx
import { ButtonProps } from "@prismane/core";
```

## Component Prop Inheritance

Our components are built in a way that they extend their child's props. For example, the `<Flex/>` component extends it's child props, in this case the `<Box/>` component's props.

```tsx
const Page = () => {
  return (
    <Flex
      w={20} // Box component's prop
      align="center" // Flex component's prop
    >
      Hello, world
    </Flex>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

## Versatile Components

Some of our components are versatile, meaning that they have the ability to change their root element for an element that you have passed. They have an additional `as` prop. By default versatile components render as a `<div/>` element.

```tsx
import { Flex } from "@prismane/core";

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <Flex as="a" href="#">
      Hello, world
    </Flex>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

This code snippet will render an anchor tag that has display property of flex.

## Passing refs

All of our components use the `forwardRef` function, so that you can easily pass a ref to the component by using the `ref` prop.

```tsx
import { useRef } from "react";
import { Flex } from "@prismane/core";

const Page = () => {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  return <Flex ref={ref}>Hello, world</Flex>;
};

export default Page;
```
