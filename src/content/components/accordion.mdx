# Accordion

Accordion displays a list of options that can be expanded or collapsed.

## Import

```js
import { Accordion } from "@prismane/core";
```

## Usage

You can have an expanded element by default, by providing a value to the `defaultValue` prop of the `Accordion` component.

```jsx
<Accordion defaultValue="first">
  <Accordion.Item value="first">
    <Accordion.Control>
      First
      <Accordion.Icon />
    </Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>First Panel Content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>

  <Accordion.Item value="second">
    <Accordion.Control>
      Second
      <Accordion.Icon />
    </Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>Second Panel Content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```

### Custom Accordion Icon

By providing a child to `Accordion.Icon` you can change the default icon that will be displayed. You can also style it, by providing a function that returns an element as a child. This function accepts the parameter of `active`, which will be toggled on or off when the item is active and when it's.

```jsx
<Accordion defaultValue="first">
  <Accordion.Item value="first">
    <Accordion.Control>
      First
      <Accordion.Icon>
        {(active) => (
          <Transition
            as={Plus}
            style={{ transform: active ? "rotate(135deg)" : "rotate(0deg)" }}
          />
        )}
      </Accordion.Icon>
    </Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>First Panel Content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>

  <Accordion.Item value="second">
    <Accordion.Control>
      Second
      <Accordion.Icon>
        {(active) => (
          <Transition
            as={Plus}
            style={{ transform: active ? "rotate(135deg)" : "rotate(0deg)" }}
          />
        )}
      </Accordion.Icon>
    </Accordion.Control>
    <Accordion.Panel>Second Panel Content</Accordion.Panel>
  </Accordion.Item>
</Accordion>
```
