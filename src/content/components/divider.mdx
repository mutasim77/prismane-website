### Article Example

The `Divider` component is very commonly used to separate an article visually.

```jsx
<Stack>
  <Text as="h1">Enchanting Waterfalls</Text>
  <Divider />
  <Text>
    Immerse yourself in the breathtaking beauty of nature's marvels â€“ the
    cascading waterfalls. Discover nature's symphony as water gracefully dances
    down rugged cliffs, filling the air with a soothing melody. Feel the cool
    mist on your skin and the invigorating rush of energy that these natural
    wonders evoke. Each waterfall is a unique masterpiece, adorned with lush
    greenery, vibrant wildlife, and hidden grottos. Witness the raw power and
    tranquility coexisting in harmony, and let the enchanting waterfalls
    transport you to a world of awe and wonder, where nature's magic reigns
    supreme.
  </Text>
</Stack>
```

### Divider Variants

By default, `Divider` uses the `solid` variant.

```jsx
<>
  <Divider variant="solid" />
  <Divider variant="dashed" />
  <Divider variant="dotted" />
</>
```

### Title Example

The `Divider` is commonly used to attract the user's attention to a title on the page.

```jsx
<Flex align="center" w="100%" gap={fr(2)}>
  <Divider />
  <Text as="h1">Prismane</Text>
  <Divider />
</Flex>
```

### Divider Orientations

By default, `Divider` uses the `horizontal` orientation, but it also supports a `vertical` one.

```jsx
<Divider orientation="horizontal" />
```

```jsx
<Center w="100%" h={fr(20)}>
  <Divider orientation="vertical" />
</Center>
```

### Vertical Divider Example

The `Divider` component with `orientation` of `vertical` has a very common use case to separate images from text.

```jsx
<Flex gap={fr(6)} align="center" miw={fr(192)}>
  <Square size={fr(32)} miw={fr(32)} br="md" of="hidden">
    <Image
      src="https://www.heinemann.com/shared/covers/9780867090192.jpg"
      fit="cover"
    />
  </Square>
  <Divider orientation="vertical" />
  <Stack>
    <Text as="h1">Hamlet</Text>
    <Text maw={fr(144)}>
      Hamlet is a tragedy play written by William Shakespeare, telling the story
      of Prince Hamlet seeking revenge for his father's death. Fueled by his
      inner turmoil, Hamlet grapples with existential questions, madness, and
      the consequences of his actions.
    </Text>
